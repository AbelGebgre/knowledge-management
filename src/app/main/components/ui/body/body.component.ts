                          sharing, structuring and auditing knowledge, in order to maximize the effectiveness of an organizationâ€™s collective knowledge.
                          The goal is to enable organizational learning and create a learning culture, where the sharing of knowledge is encouraged and those who seek to learn to better themselves find it easy to do so.
                          When thinking about knowledge management, it is helpful to consider the types of knowledge and how possible it is to share that knowledge within an organization.
                          Tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge are the two main types of knowledge covered within the definition of knowledge management.
                          Tacit knowledge is more intuitive, less easy to package and share with others. Examples of tacit knowledge are innovative thinking and understanding body language.
                          Explicit knowledge is information that is easily codified and taught, such as how to change the toner in a printer and mathematical equations.
                          Successful knowledge management will improve an organization in several ways. It will ensure that the specialized knowledge of employees does not leave with them, or go unutilized by other employees who would benefit from that knowledge.
                          It allows for better situational awareness, as well as opening doors for learning about best practices, lessons learned, and overall organizational improvement.`;
